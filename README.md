# update-2-9-26
An update on where I have been since last week. 

Last week I have been job searching and studying my knownledge on troubleshooting. I have contacted at least 4 job agencies and the troubleshooting sessions have been burning me out lately. I hope to get back to creating some small projects this week on GitHub and hopefully create another project that I can include on my resume. 

My goals for this week is to pay a vist to the local library and see what resoruces are available to me. Plus letting my friends know about the job searching I am currently doing and share them my resume. 

Wish me luck in my serach. If anything comes up I hope to provide an update to you all. 

Sincerely, 
Ralph Ayala
